Hello visitor!

This is the github repo to my blog / portfolio that you can check out here - [Aditya Mangal Portfolio](https://www.adityamangal.com/)

You can get most of the information about me on the blog. Some more things about me here -   

1. I work in the Location Center of Excellence at Yahoo. 
2. I'm originally from India, currently living in the San Francisco Bay Area since past few years. 
3. I like to blog about technical stuff mostly related to Data Science and Machine Learning. 
4. Java is my first love and R/Python are competing for a close second. 
4. In an ideal world, this blog would also contain my writings about travel, random musings and photography among other things. One day, some day. 
5. If you have any questions or suggestions or feedback, you're always welcome to connect with me at adityamangal410 [at] yahoo [dot] co [in].
